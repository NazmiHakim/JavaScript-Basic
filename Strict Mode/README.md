# Strict Mode Example

This example demonstrates the use of JavaScript's strict mode, which helps catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions such as gaining access to the global object.

## Description

The script defines a function `useStrictMode` that attempts to use the `with` statement inside strict mode. The `with` statement is disallowed in strict mode, and this script demonstrates the resulting error.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and the embedded JavaScript code.

## JavaScript Code Explanation

- `useStrictMode` function:
  - Enables strict mode by using `'use strict';` at the beginning of the function.
  - Defines a constant object `person` with a property `firstName`.
  - Attempts to use the `with` statement on the `person` object, which is not allowed in strict mode and will throw an error.

## Usage

To see the code in action:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Open the browser's console to see the error message generated by the `with` statement.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Strict Mode Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        // Strict Mode
        function useStrictMode() {
            'use strict';
            const person = {
                firstName: "Nazmi"
            }
            with (person) { // "with" is not allowed in strict mode
                console.info(firstName);
            }
        }

        // Call the function to see the error in console
        useStrictMode();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Learning Points

- Strict mode helps in catching common errors such as using the `with` statement.
- It prevents the use of potentially dangerous features and makes debugging easier by throwing errors for common mistakes.
