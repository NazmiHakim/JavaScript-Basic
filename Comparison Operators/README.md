# JavaScript Comparison Operators Example

This is a simple example demonstrating JavaScript comparison operators and their behavior.

## Description

The provided JavaScript code demonstrates various comparison operators and their results:

- `==`: Tests for equality, performs type coercion if necessary.
- `===`: Tests for equality without type coercion (strict equality).
- `<`: Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- `>`: Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- `>=`: Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
- `<=`: Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
- `!=`: Checks if the operands are not equal, performs type coercion if necessary.
- `!==`: Checks if the operands are not equal without type coercion (strict inequality).

## Usage

You can copy the provided JavaScript code and run it in your browser's developer console or in a JavaScript environment to observe the output.

## Example Output

- `true` (due to type coercion)
- `false` (strict comparison of different types)
- `true`
- `false`
- `true`
- `true`
- `true`
- `true`
- `true` (strict comparison of different types)
