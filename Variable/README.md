# JavaScript Variable Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the usage of variables in JavaScript. Two separate HTML files demonstrate the usage of different types of variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

## File Structure

- **Var.html**: This file contains examples demonstrating the usage of `var` variables.
- **LetConst.html**: This file contains examples demonstrating the usage of `let` and `const` variables.

## Usage

### `var` Variables (index.html)

The `Var.html` file demonstrates the usage of `var` variables. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using the `var` keyword. Variables declared with `var` have function scope, meaning they are accessible within the function in which they are declared.

The example code in this file shows how to declare and use `var` variables for storing and accessing information such as full name, first name, and last name. It also illustrates how you can update the values of `var` variables.

### `let` and `const` Variables (index2.html)

The `LetConst.html` file demonstrates the usage of `let` and `const` variables. 

- **`let` Variables**: Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are accessible only within the block in which they are declared. The example code showcases the usage of `let` to declare variables for storing a numerical value (NIM) and a string (Name).

- **`const` Variables**: Variables declared with `const` are constants, meaning their value cannot be changed once assigned. The example code demonstrates how to declare and use `const` variables for storing a constant value (Language) and how attempting to reassign a value to a `const` variable results in an error.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` and `index2.html` in a web browser to view the examples.
3. Examine the source code in the HTML files to understand how variables are declared and used in JavaScript.

Feel free to experiment with the code and make changes to understand the behavior of variables in JavaScript.
