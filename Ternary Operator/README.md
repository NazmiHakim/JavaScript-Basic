# Ternary Operator Example

This is a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of conditional statements to evaluate a user's input value and provide feedback based on certain conditions.

## How it Works

1. The program prompts the user to input a value.
2. It then evaluates the input value using a series of conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) to determine the appropriate message to display.
3. The conditions are as follows:
   - If the value is equal to 100, it displays "Perfect!".
   - If the value is greater than or equal to 75, it displays "Good!".
   - If the value is greater than or equal to 50, it displays "Meh".
   - If the value is greater than or equal to 25, it displays "Try Again".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it displays "You Failed".

## Example Usage

- Input: 90
  - Output: "Good!"

- Input: 30
  - Output: "Try Again"

- Input: 10
  - Output: "You Failed"
