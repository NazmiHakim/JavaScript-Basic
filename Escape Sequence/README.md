## JavaScript Textarea Escape Characters Demo

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to populate a textarea element with various escape characters. The included script outputs text containing escape characters such as newline (\n), tab (\t), backslash (\\), double quote (\\"), and single quote (\').

### Usage

To use this demonstration, simply open the provided HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser. The textarea will display text containing different escape characters, showing how they affect the output.

### Example Output

- "Nazmi \nHakim" : Inserts a newline between "Nazmi" and "Hakim".
- "Nazmi \tHakim" : Inserts a tab between "Nazmi" and "Hakim".
- "\\Nazmi \\Hakim" : Escapes backslashes before "Nazmi" and "Hakim".
- "\"Nazmi Hakim\"" : Encloses "Nazmi Hakim" within double quotes.
- "\'Nazmi Hakim\'" : Encloses "Nazmi Hakim" within single quotes.
