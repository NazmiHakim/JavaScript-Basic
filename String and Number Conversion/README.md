# String and Number Conversion

This project consists of two HTML files: `StringAndNumberConversion.html` and `StringAndNumberConversion2.html`. Both files demonstrate the problem that can occur if data types are not properly converted, along with various methods for converting between strings and numbers in JavaScript.

## Contents

- [StringAndNumberConversion2.html](#stringandnumberconversion2html)

## StringAndNumberConversion.html

This file demonstrates the potential issues that can arise when performing operations with variables of different data types without proper conversion. It showcases various methods for converting strings to numbers and vice versa in JavaScript.

### Code Snippets

- `value1` and `value2` are used as user inputs, one as a string and the other as a number. Their sum is calculated without conversion, resulting in concatenation instead of addition.
- Different conversion methods such as `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, `Number()`, and `toString()` are demonstrated with examples.
- The usage of `NaN` (Not a Number) is illustrated when improper conversion or invalid input is encountered.

## StringAndNumberConversion2.html

Similar to the first file, this one also demonstrates string-to-number and number-to-string conversions using various JavaScript methods. It showcases correct conversion techniques to avoid unexpected behavior.

### Code Snippets

- Demonstrates correct conversion techniques using methods like `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, `Number()`, and `toString()`.
- Highlights the importance of proper conversion to ensure accurate mathematical operations and string manipulation.

## Usage

Open each HTML file in a web browser to see the output in the console or directly on the web page.

```bash
# Example usage
$ open StringAndNumberConversion.html
$ open StringAndNumberConversion2.html
```
