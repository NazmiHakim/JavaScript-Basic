# JavaScript Looping Examples

This repository contains two JavaScript code snippets demonstrating looping techniques.

## Code 1: Nested Looping

The first code snippet demonstrates nested looping using `for` loops.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this code is to generate and display combinations of two variables `i` and `j` ranging from 0 to 99.

### Usage:

1. Open the provided HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. The browser will render the output generated by the JavaScript code in the `<script>` tags.
3. The output will display pairs of numbers in the format `i - j`, where `i` and `j` range from 0 to 99.

## Code 2: Nested Looping with `continue` Statement

The second code snippet demonstrates the use of the `continue` statement with labeled loops.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to use the `continue` statement with a labeled loop to skip iterations of the outer loop based on a condition in the inner loop.

### Usage:

1. Open the provided HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. The browser will render the output generated by the JavaScript code in the `<script>` tags.
3. The output will display pairs of numbers in the format `i:j`, where `i` ranges from 0 to 23 and `j` ranges from 0 to 99. However, when `j` is greater than 59, the loop over `i` continues to the next iteration, skipping the remaining iterations of the inner loop for that `i` value.
