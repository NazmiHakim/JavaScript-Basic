# Mathematical and Unary Operators

This repository contains two HTML files demonstrating the use of mathematical and unary operators in JavaScript.

## MathematicalOperators.html

This file showcases various mathematical operations using JavaScript. Each operation is performed and the result is displayed using document.writeln(). The operations demonstrated include:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Exponentiation
- Division
- Modulo

## UnaryOperators.html

This file illustrates the use of unary operators in JavaScript. Unary operators act on a single operand. The following unary operators are demonstrated:
