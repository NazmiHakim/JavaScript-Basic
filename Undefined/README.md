# Understanding JavaScript's `undefined` Keyword

This README provides insights into the behavior of the `undefined` keyword in JavaScript, demonstrated through code examples.

## Code Snippet Explanation

The provided code snippet contains JavaScript code within a `<script>` tag. Let's break down the code and understand each part:

1. **Variable Declaration with `let`**: 
    ```javascript
    let value
    ```
   Here, a variable named `value` is declared using the `let` keyword but not assigned any value explicitly.

2. **Condition Checking for `undefined`**:
    ```javascript
    if (value === undefined)
        alert("UNDEFINED")
    else
        alert("DEFINED");
    ```
   This code block checks whether the variable `value` is `undefined` using strict equality (`===`). If it is `undefined`, it alerts `"UNDEFINED"`, otherwise `"DEFINED"`.

3. **Variable Assignment and Checking**:
    ```javascript
    let value2 = 1
    if (value2 === undefined)
        alert("UNDEFINED")
    else
        alert("DEFINED");
    ```
   Here, a value (`1`) is assigned to the variable `value2`, and then a similar check is performed as in the previous case.

4. **Array Element Access**:
    ```javascript
    let names = ["Nazmi", "Hakim"]
    if (names[2] === undefined)
        alert("UNDEFINED")
    else
        alert("DEFINED");
    ```
   This part tries to access the third element of the `names` array, which doesn't exist. Therefore, it checks whether `names[2]` is `undefined` or not.

## Expected Output

Considering the code logic, we can predict the following outputs:

- The first `alert` will display `"UNDEFINED"` because `value` has been declared but not assigned any value.
- The second `alert` will display `"DEFINED"` because `value2` has been assigned a value (`1`).
- The third `alert` will display `"UNDEFINED"` because the third element of the `names` array does not exist.

## Conclusion

Through this code snippet, we observe how JavaScript handles `undefined` in different scenarios, such as with uninitialized variables and accessing non-existent array elements. Understanding this behavior is crucial for writing robust JavaScript code.
