# Array Operations in JavaScript

This repository contains examples of array operations in JavaScript. The provided code demonstrates how to perform various operations such as creating arrays, adding data to arrays, accessing elements by index, and modifying array elements.

## Usage

To use the code examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `array.html` file in a web browser.
3. Open the browser's developer console to see the output of the JavaScript code.

## Code Explanation

- `emptyArray`: Declares an empty array.
- `nameArray`: Declares an array with two string elements: "Nazmi" and "Hakim".
- `numbers`: Declares an empty array and then adds several numeric elements using the `push()` method.
- `names`: Declares an array with one string element: "Nazmi Hakim", and then adds another string element using the `push()` method.
- Various array operations are demonstrated, including accessing elements by index, changing values at specific indices, and deleting elements from arrays.

## Array Operations Demonstrated

- Adding data to an array using `push()`.
- Getting the length of an array using `length`.
- Accessing elements by index.
- Modifying array elements by index.
- Deleting array elements without changing the array length using `delete`.

## Output

The code outputs the results of array operations to the browser's console and also displays some results directly in the HTML document.
