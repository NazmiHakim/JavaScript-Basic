# JavaScript While Loop Examples

This repository contains two JavaScript examples demonstrating the use of while loops.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find two JavaScript examples:

1. **While Loop**: This script demonstrates a basic while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
2. **While Loop 2**: This script prompts the user to input either 1 or 2. If the user inputs 1, it continuously alerts "1", and if the user inputs 2, it continuously alerts "2".
