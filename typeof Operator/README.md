# typeof Operator Demo

This script demonstrates the usage of the typeof operator in JavaScript to determine the type of different data types.

## Description

The `typeof` operator in JavaScript is used to determine the type of a variable or value. It returns a string indicating the type of the operand.

In this script, we have declared several variables of different data types and then used the `typeof` operator to determine their types. The types of data used in this demonstration include:

- Integer
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined

## Usage

To run this script:

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. The script will execute and display the types of the variables in the document body.

## Example

Suppose we have the following variables:

```javascript
let data1 = 100;      // Integer
let data2 = "100";    // String
let data3 = true;     // Boolean
let data4 = null;     // Null
let data5;            // Undefined

After running the script, the output will be:
number
string
boolean
object
undefined
```
