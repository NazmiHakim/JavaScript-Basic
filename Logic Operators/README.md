# Logical Operators Example

This is a simple JavaScript example demonstrating the usage of logical operators: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

## Description

1. **Logical AND (`&&`)**:
   - Declares two variables `x` and `y`.
   - Checks if both `x` and `y` are positive numbers using the logical AND operator.
   - Outputs whether both `x` and `y` are positive or not.

2. **Logical OR (`||`)**:
   - Declares two variables `isRaining` and `isSunny`.
   - Checks if it's either raining or sunny using the logical OR operator.
   - Outputs whether it's either raining or sunny, or neither.

3. **Logical NOT (`!`)**:
   - Declares a variable `isLogged`.
   - Checks if the user is logged in using the logical NOT operator.
   - Outputs whether the user is logged in or not.
