# Logical Operators Example

This is a simple JavaScript example demonstrating the usage of logical operators: AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/logical-operators-example.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd logical-operators-example
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Description

The `index.html` file contains JavaScript code embedded within the `<script>` tags. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

1. **Logical AND (`&&`)**:
   - Declares two variables `x` and `y`.
   - Checks if both `x` and `y` are positive numbers using the logical AND operator.
   - Outputs whether both `x` and `y` are positive or not.

2. **Logical OR (`||`)**:
   - Declares two variables `isRaining` and `isSunny`.
   - Checks if it's either raining or sunny using the logical OR operator.
   - Outputs whether it's either raining or sunny, or neither.

3. **Logical NOT (`!`)**:
   - Declares a variable `isLogged`.
   - Checks if the user is logged in using the logical NOT operator.
   - Outputs whether the user is logged in or not.
